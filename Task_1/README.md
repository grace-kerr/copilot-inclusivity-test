# Task 1 – Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## Instructions to Participant

You will be writing a function that finds the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

You may use GitHub Copilot to help you generate or complete the code.

## Problem Description

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Examples:
- Input: `s = "abcabcbb"` → Output: `3` (The answer is "abc", with the length of 3)
- Input: `s = "bbbbb"` → Output: `1` (The answer is "b", with the length of 1)
- Input: `s = "pwwkew"` → Output: `3` (The answer is "wke", with the length of 3)

## Getting Started

1. Open `src/main/java/SubstringTasks.java`
2. Implement the `lengthOfLongestSubstring` method
3. Run the tests to verify your solution: `mvn test`

## Testing Your Solution

Run the following command to test your implementation:
```bash
mvn test
```

The tests are located in `src/test/java/SubstringTasksTest.java`.
